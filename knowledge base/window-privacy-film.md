summary: Frosted vinyl options, ordering steps, and care guidance for privacy film installs at homes or workplaces.
---

## Overview
- Etched vinyl delivers a sandblasted, translucent finish that obscures interiors while allowing natural light.
- Ideal for homes (net curtain alternative), bathrooms, kitchens, and office partitions or meeting rooms.
- Can double as glass manifestation to meet safety regulations when applied at required heights.

## Ordering Workflow
1. **Site Survey or Self-Measure** – team can visit to capture measurements/photos, or you can submit your own.
2. **Design + Quote** – designers prepare visuals showing coverage, cut-outs, or patterns; logo design available if needed.
3. **Approval** – confirm artwork and schedule production/installation.
4. **Installation** – insured installers apply film on-site; DIY supply (roll or cut-to-size with decals) available.

## Customisation Options
- **Full Coverage:** maximizes privacy; various translucency levels demonstrate how shapes appear in different lighting.
- **Cut-Outs:** add branding, text, or directional icons.
- **Layered Decals:** combine coloured vinyl behind etched film for illuminated, lightbox-style effects at night.
- **Patterns & Colours:** choose from stock motifs or custom artwork; lighter/heavier opacities and coloured frosts offered.

## Installation Support
- Professional team covers Midlands homes and workplaces with bubble-free application and access equipment as required.
- DIY kits include pre-cut panels, fixings, and guidance for confident self-installation.

## Care Instructions
- Wait 3 weeks after fitting before first clean.
- Clean with mild soapy water using a soft cloth or paper towel; avoid abrasive cleaners.
- For printed films or intricate cut-outs, wipe gently around exposed edges; do not use squeegees or excessive pressure.
