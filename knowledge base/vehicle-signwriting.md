summary: Consultation process, pricing bands, and vinyl specification for permanent vehicle branding.
---

## Overview
- Turn work vehicles into rolling advertisements with custom decals, partial wraps, or full livery.
- In-house design team leverages scaled vehicle drawings or on-site measurements to visualise concepts.
- Professional installers apply graphics at the Kidderminster unit, on late-evening/weekend slots, or at customer sites (subject to access and weather).

## Ordering Workflow
1. **Consultation** – book a free visit or drop-in to capture measurements/photos. Standard vehicles use a drawing library; off-spec models get hands-on assessment.
2. **Design & Quote** – send logos/briefs for mockups; in-house team can develop new branding if required. Receive pricing with visual proofs.
3. **Approval** – confirm artwork and schedule production/installation (late-night Wednesday or Saturday slots available; mobile installs offered).
4. **Installation** – bring the vehicle in or host the team on-site. Fully insured installers handle prep and fitting; DIY supply (rolled or pre-cut graphics) available on request.

## Pricing Guidelines (typical ranges)
- **Cars & “Caddy” Vans:** £200–£400 for all sides plus optional bonnet logo.
- **SWB–LWB “Transit” Vans:** £300–£550 for full panel coverage.
- **Luton / Box Vans:** £500–£800 for full sides plus optional bonnet.
- Pricing reflects cut vinyl and/or digitally printed vinyl applied to each panel; final costs depend on design complexity, coverage, and vinyl choice.

## Why It Pays Off
- A one-time investment (~£500) delivers constant advertising 24/7, reaching thousands of drivers annually.
- Graphics elevate professionalism on-site and differentiate services from competitors.
- For temporary branding needs, see the companion article on magnetic vehicle signs.

## Vinyl Options

### Printed Vinyl
- Best for multi-colour artwork, gradients, photos, textures, metallic, fluorescent, glitter, or holographic effects.
- Printed onto white/clear vinyl then laminated (matt or gloss) for UV and abrasion resistance.
- Easier “peel-and-stick” application but thicker material can be harder to remove years later.

### Cut Vinyl
- Precision-cut from pre-coloured polymeric films; no background so surface colour shows through.
- Ideal for simple logos, lettering, and solid shapes; metallic/neon/glitter films available.
- Layers of multiple colours can be combined for more complex designs.
- Thin profile gives a painted look and is easier to remove without tearing.

## Vinyl Specifications
- **Gloss Polymeric:** 36 colour palette, permanent acrylic adhesive, 5–7 year exterior life (10+ year films available).
- **Matt Polymeric:** 37 colours, permanent adhesive, 3–5 year exterior life (longer for black/white). Resistant to UV, seawater, oils, hydrocarbons; self-extinguishing.
- Both formats conform well to curves and are suited for long-term exterior use.

## Application Considerations
- Printed vinyl closely mimics traditional stickers; cut vinyl requires more precise installation and layering.
- Colour Matching: printed vinyl matches Pantone/RGB/CMYK references; cut vinyl limited to stock colours (complex logos may need simplification).
- Finishes: printed vinyl relies on laminate choice; cut vinyl offers metallic, neon, brushed, chrome, glitter, etc.
- Longevity: cut vinyl resists fade longer because colour runs through the material; printed vinyl relies on laminate for UV protection.
- Removal: printed vinyl is thicker and can snap when peeling; cut vinyl is thinner but requires patience to lift edges.

## Installation & Support
- Professional team travels across the Midlands with full insurance, access equipment, and flexible scheduling; removal services available.
- DIY kits supplied with application tape, positioning guides, and care instructions for confident self-fit.
