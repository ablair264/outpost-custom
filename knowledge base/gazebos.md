## Overview
- Turn required outdoor shelters into branded marketing space with custom canopies and walls.
- Supply your own structure or choose from curated gazebos tested for commercial use.
- Replacement canopies/walls available to refresh existing frames.

## Ordering Workflow
1. **Select Your Canvas** – drop off an existing gazebo or pick from vetted models.
2. **Free Quote & Mockup** – send logos for visual concepts; in-house designers can build artwork or logos if needed.
3. **Approval** – upon sign-off, production typically takes 5–10 working days (rush timelines on request).
4. **Fulfilment** – collect from Kidderminster or request delivery.
