## Overview
- Printed parasol umbrellas provide shade plus high-visibility branding for outdoor markets, hospitality terraces, and events.
- Supply your own parasol or select from vetted models curated for durability and budget fit.
- Replacement canopies available for refreshes or seasonal campaigns.

## Ordering Workflow
1. **Choose Your Canvas** – drop off an existing parasol or pick from recommended models.
2. **Free Quote & Mockup** – send logos/artwork for visual concepts; in-house team can create logos if required.
3. **Approval** – once artwork is signed off, production takes roughly 5–10 working days (rush options on request).
4. **Fulfilment** – collect in Kidderminster or arrange delivery; installation guidance provided.
