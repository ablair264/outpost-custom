summary: Double-sided projecting sign options, ordering workflow, and bracket specifications.
---

## Overview
- Projecting signs boost visibility for pedestrians moving parallel to shopfronts by extending perpendicular to the wall.
- Modular approach: choose a bracket style, pair with a preferred panel, then add custom graphics.
- Designed for outdoor durability; built with premium materials and weather-resistant finishes.

## Ordering Workflow
1. **Free Quote** – mix and match bracket styles with standard panel sizes, or request bespoke dimensions.
2. **Design Stage** – submit artwork for proofing or brief the studio for custom visuals; logo development available.
3. **Approval** – once artwork and pricing are signed off, production typically takes 5–10 working days.
4. **Fulfilment** – collect in Kidderminster, arrange delivery (from £10), or book the installation team for on-site fitting.
