## Overview
- Ideal for drivers who alternate between business and personal use or consult for multiple brands.

- Media is 0.85 mm thick, speed-tested to 70 mph, and adheres to any ferromagnetic surface.

## Ordering Workflow

2. **Design Stage** – send artwork for proofing or supply logos for bespoke layouts; in-house logo creation available.
3. **Approval** – production lead time typically 5–10 working days; rush timelines handled case-by-case.
4. **Fulfilment** – collect locally or request delivery (from £10).

## Colour Matching & Materials
- High-performance vinyl graphics rated for minimum 5-year exterior life under normal exposure.
- Colour consultation ensures backgrounds match automotive paint (including metallic finishes) so magnets blend seamlessly.

## Care & Usage Guidelines
- Remove magnets at least weekly to clean/dry the bodywork underneath; more frequently in extreme weather.
- Wait for new paint (90 days), clear coat (60 days), or wax (2 days) to cure before applying magnets.
- Avoid non-flat surfaces with heavy dips/bumps; slight curves are acceptable.
- Expected lifespan ~2 years with proper care; inspect regularly to prevent drop-offs at speed.
- Remove before vehicle washing; store flat when not in use.

## Customisation Methods
- **Printed Vinyl:** supports multicolour graphics, gradients, photos, metallic, fluorescent, glitter, holographic effects; laminated in matt or gloss.
- **Cut Vinyl:** best for simple logos/text with crisp edges; no background so base colour shows through; available in metallic, neon, and specialty finishes. Multiple colours are layered as needed.
- Team can recommend the optimal method based on artwork complexity, colour requirements, and budget.

## Support
- Contact for size recommendations, colour references, rush orders, or advice on when magnets are preferable versus permanent signwriting.
