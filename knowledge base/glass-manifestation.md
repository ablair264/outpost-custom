summary: Legal requirements, workflow, and customisation options for etched manifestation graphics on commercial glazing.
---

## Overview
- Glass manifestation is legally required on large transparent surfaces to prevent collisions and ensure compliance with Building Regulations (Approved Document K5.2) and DDA guidance.
- Etched or frosted window film makes glass visible without sacrificing style; decals can incorporate logos, patterns, or directional text.
- Suitable for offices, retail fronts, doors, partitions, bathrooms, and kitchens (condensation resistant).

## Why It Is Required
- Regulation K5.2: transparent glazing people may contact must include permanent markers to make it apparent.
- Markers must appear at two heights: 850–1000 mm and 1400–1600 mm from the floor, visible inside and out in varied lighting.
- Frosted films provide the necessary contrast and permanence while allowing natural light transmission.

## Ordering & Installation Workflow
1. **Free Site Survey** – schedule measurement and photography, or supply your own dimensions/photos for remote quoting.
2. **Design + Quote** – studio prepares visuals showing pattern placement and any branding; logo creation support is available.
3. **Approval** – confirm artwork and pricing, then book a production/install slot.
4. **Installation** – fully insured fitters apply the film on site; DIY supply (roll or cut-to-size) also available.

## Customisation Options
- **Patterns:** choose from 16 stock designs or request bespoke motifs for subtle markers.
- **Text:** integrate wayfinding or notices that double as visibility strips.
- **Logos:** embed branding into the etched film for consistent identity.
- **Opacity Choices:** standard film allows ~80% of light; lighter or heavier frosts available plus coloured films.

## Installation Team
- Experienced technicians cover the Midlands, providing bubble-free application, access equipment, and optional removal of existing graphics.
- DIY customers can receive pre-cut panels and fitting guidance.

## Care & Maintenance
- Wait at least 3 weeks before first clean.
- Use mild soapy water with a soft cloth; avoid abrasive pads or squeegees, especially on cut-out edges.
- For printed or layered films, wipe gently around exposed edges to preserve detail.
