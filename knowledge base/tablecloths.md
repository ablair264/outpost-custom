summary: Fabric options, ordering workflow, and branding methods for bespoke promotional table covers.
---

## Overview
- Dress trestle tables, registration desks, or merch counters with branded throws that match the rest of your event kit.
- Options include loose drapes, fitted covers, or stretch wraps sized to common table dimensions or custom builds.
- Graphics can highlight primary logos, slogans, or campaign artwork.

## Ordering Workflow
1. **Free Quote** – share table dimensions (length, width, height) plus preferred style (loose, fitted, stretch).
2. **Design Stage** – send artwork for proofing or brief the studio for bespoke layouts/logos.
3. **Approval** – once visuals and pricing are signed off, production typically takes 5–10 working days.
4. **Fulfilment** – collect locally or request delivery; storage and care instructions supplied with each cover.

## Fabric & Style Options
- **Polyester Throw (Most Versatile):** drapes over the table with box pleats or rounded corners; can cover 3 or 4 sides depending on access needs.
- **Fitted Cover:** sewn corners for a crisp silhouette; ideal for retail or exhibition pods where audiences see multiple sides.
- **Stretch Fabric:** elasticated edges hug cocktail tables or tall displays; works well outdoors in breezy conditions.
- **Materials:** wrinkle-resistant polyester blends suited for dye-sublimation printing; fire-retardant fabrics available on request.
- **Sizing:** standard 4 ft, 6 ft, and 8 ft trestle dimensions plus custom measurements for reception desks or counters.

## Branding Methods
- **Full-Colour Dye Sublimation:** best for all-over coverage, gradients, patterns, and photography; artwork saturates the fabric for long-lasting colour.
- **Heat-Applied Vinyl Panels:** cost-effective for spot logos on stock-colour cloths; suitable for single or dual colour designs.
- **Mixed Approach:** combine base colour panels with vinyl overlays for seasonal messaging.

## Care Instructions
- Machine wash on cool setting with mild detergent; avoid bleach or fabric softener.
- Air-dry or tumble-dry low; remove promptly to minimise creasing.
- Store folded in supplied bags; steam or lightly iron (poly-safe setting) before events if required.

- Contact the team for sizing help, design templates, Pantone matching, or rush-order availability.
